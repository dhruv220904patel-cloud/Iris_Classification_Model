# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to classify **Iris flower species** (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`) using **Logistic Regression** in Python.  
It uses the famous **Iris dataset** from `scikit-learn` and includes **data visualization** to better understand the model’s performance.

## 📌 Features
- Loads the **Iris dataset** using `scikit-learn`
- Splits data into **train** and **test** sets
- **Standardizes** features for better performance
- Trains a **Logistic Regression** classification model
- Evaluates the model with:
  - Accuracy score
  - Classification report
  - Confusion matrix
- Visualizes:
  - Pairplot of features
  - Confusion matrix heatmap
  - Feature importance plot
